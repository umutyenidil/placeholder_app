# Flutter Clean Architecture App

## Overview

This Flutter application is built using **Clean Architecture** principles, aiming for modularity, testability, and scalability. The app interacts with external APIs to fetch **albums** and **posts** and displays the data efficiently using a state management system.

## Key Technologies & Packages

This project incorporates several important libraries and packages to adhere to best practices and ensure a smooth development experience:

- **[go_router](https://pub.dev/packages/go_router)**: Declarative routing to handle navigation in a clean and structured way.
- **[Bloc & Provider](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc)**: For state management, allowing reactive and predictable UI updates.
- **[Equatable](https://pub.dev/packages/equatable)**: Simplifies equality comparisons within state management, especially for Bloc.
- **[Dartz](https://pub.dev/packages/dartz)**: Enables functional programming, particularly helpful for handling `Either` types, reducing boilerplate error handling.
- **[Get_it](https://pub.dev/packages/get_it)**: Used as a service locator for dependency injection, making it easier to decouple classes and manage dependencies.

## App Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture**, which separates the codebase into distinct layers. Each layer is responsible for a specific part of the applicationâ€™s functionality:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Contains the UI and handles interaction with the user through **Bloc**.
2. **Domain Layer**: Contains business logic, including use cases and models.
3. **Data Layer**: Manages data access, whether from the API, local storage, or other sources, and implements repositories.

## Features

- Fetch and display **albums** and **posts** using the provided APIs.
- Navigate between different sections of the app using **go_router**.
- Reactive state management with **Bloc** and **Provider**.
- Improved equality checks with **Equatable**.
- Functional programming techniques using **Dartz** for better error handling.
- Clean dependency injection with **Get_it** for managing services and repositories.
